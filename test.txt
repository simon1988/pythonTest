Fog index calculator, using your favorite programming language:
 
Design and write an application that can parse a text file and produce a fog index score, and other statistics for the 

document. A fog index is a readability score for a document. Using this "fog"  index, we can judge what reading material 

is good for different ages of students. For the purposes of this exercise we will use a simplified fog index defined as 

follows:
 
Fog index = 0.4 * (words / sentence) + 100 (Complex Words / Words).
 
Complex Words are words with more 5 or more letters and 2 or more vowels.
 
The applications should report:
 
The fog index.
The total number of words and sentences in the document.
The average number of words per sentence.
The fog index per sentence.
